### **"The use of chaotic systems to generate random numbers: chua's circuit"** <br />
x,y and z scripts simply plot the corresponding variables while 3d displays the double-scroll attractor. <br />
Firstly, generate the list of numbers by running gen_list.py. <br />
You could visualize the result as a pixalized black and white image using img.py. <br />
To run the monobit test, execute run.py and supply data.bin as an argument. <br />
